# CookBook

A shameless copy of our friends over at [UQCS](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety)

## Getting Started

All contributions will require the following:

  1. author details added to `./contents/authors` (see `./contents/authors/byronmejia.json` for details)
  2. articles added to './contents/articles` (see `./contents/articles/katsu-curry` for details)

For fixing the dodgy default template that Byron's copied when half asleep, ensure you outline that in your PR.
