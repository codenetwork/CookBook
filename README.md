# CookBook
A shameless copy of our friends over at UQCS: https://github.com/UQComputingSociety

## Getting Started

To contribute, please add a recipe in the recipes folder. All files should be markdown.
All files are pandoc markdown compatible. See pandoc for more fancy information. Recipes
should be original. But I don't care. I just want to learn about cooking.

## Replicating Locally

So. Since it runs pandoc. Umm. Try the make file. `make all`

You will need:

  - pdflatex
  - Pandoc

## FAQ

None so far...
