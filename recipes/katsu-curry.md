## Ingredients

### Curry Sauce

  - 30ml of vegetable oil
  - 1 white onion, finely sliced
  - 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 tbsp of mild curry powder
  - 2 tbsp of plain flour
  - 400ml kombu dashi
  - 2 1/2 tbsp of tamari soy sauce
  - 1 tbsp of honey
  - 1 tsp rice vinegar
  - 2 tsp garam masala

### Tofu Katsu

  - 300g of firm tofu
  - 1 large egg
  - 125g of plain flour
  - 100g of panko breadcrumbs
  - pinch of salt and pepper
  - vegetable oil, for frying

## Method

  1. Start by making the curry sauce. Heat the vegetable oil in a pan over a medium heat, add the onion, garlic and 
  ginger and sauté until tender, for approximately 2–3 minutes.
  2. Add the curry powder and stir until fragrant. Blend in the flour and cook for 2 minutes.
  3. Slowly pour in the dashi, soy sauce and honey. Simmer, stirring occasionally until the sauce thickens.
  4. Stir in the rice vinegar and garam masala, cook for a minute and check for salt. Keep warm until ready to serve.
  5. Cook the rice according to packet instructions.
  6. For the crispy tofu, lay a clean tea towel on a work surface and turn the tofu onto it. Slice into 1cm thick
  slices, dry the pieces well and sprinkle with salt. Leave on a clean tea towel for 10 minutes.
  7. Place the flour on a plate and season it with a pinch of salt and pepper. In a wide soup plate, add the egg
  and beat with a pinch of salt. Place the breadcrumbs in a large, shallow dish.
  8. Roll each slice of tofu in the flour, then the egg, then the breadcrumbs to coat.
  9. In a large frying pan, heat enough oil to fill it about 1.5cm deep.
  10. Shallow fry the tofu for around 2 minutes on each side or until golden, then place on kitchen paper to drain.
  11. To serve, place some rice in each bowl, place the crispy tofu on top and pour over the curry sauce. Serve with sliced spring onions or shallots and some julienned carrot.
